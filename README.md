# Montserrat Z Remix Font (Greek Support)

This remix is based on the variable font Montserrat v8.000 by Julieta Ulanovsky (https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat). The font has been modified to assure Greek language support using modified glyphs provided by the same font. 

# What is included?

It was made using FontLab 8 trial version in about 3 days, so it might still need some work. If you want to contribute, the main source file is located in sources/Source-FontLab/Montserrat-VariableFont_wght.ttf.21465ee3a80.vfc. Other source files generated by FontLab 8 have also been added but not tested in the sources folder.

The "ready to use" fonts are located inside the fonts folder in various file types. Notice: The variable font and italics versions have not been generated yet.

The styles included are the following:  
-Montserrat Z Black  
-Montserrat Z Bold  
-Montserrat Z ExtraBold  
-Montserrat Z ExtraLight  
-Montserrat Z Light  
-Montserrat Z Medium  
-Montserrat Z Regular  
-Montserrat Z SemiBold  
-Montserrat Z Thin  

Notice: The letter "Z" has been added at the end of the font family's name to avoid any conflicts with compatibility or web caching issues on different devices.
